# MDWiki Quickstart Template
This a directory that can be cloned or downloaded to get going quickly with a mdwiki based web.
you just drop this folder somewhere where it can be served to a browser and then edit away on markdown files.
The details of what and how are found on the homepage once you get it up and running.
The default filename is index.html so if that is the default for your server just navigate to the directory and 
you'll be up and running.
