### This is information on the litetouch, now [Savant](http://www.savantsystems.com/litetouch_home.aspx) lighting controller.

First off the web interface to the controller doesn't do anything.  It's not used to program or control the interface.  Thus no link is provided that being said the ip address is

192.168.0.3

One works with the controller using two programs.  

__ The litewate 6.0 database editor __ which is installed on the master computer (old version was 4.0).  The database files have the extension .lw4.   One loads and edits this file then exports it to a prg file (program file).  

Then you fire up the __ liteware "control panel" __ also installed on the master and then use the "to controller" button to upload the prg file to the 5000LC.   The control keypad tab in that program allows you to turn on and off switches.   The physical switches are wired into input modules (in the tow cabinets by the controller).  Whether a switch is actuated "virtually" from the control panel (or ios device).

These database and program files are being kept in a folder in Richard's cloud.
From Richards login that would  documents\litetouch-savant  from the master computer directly these files are located in D:\cloud-data\richard\files\documents\litetouch-savant but a shortcut on the master computer to this folder has been placed on the desktop.  To avoid confusion of files program files are in the subfolder programs and backup copies of the database are in the database subfolder.  

The procedure should be you edit the 'editing file'  you then make a program file from it and upload it to the controller.  WHen you confirm all is good than save a copy of the database (.lw4) file to the database subfolder, include the date in the title and remove editing, and also set it to readonly.

The program files are not a big deal. They can be downloaded any time from the controller or generated from any of the database files so no need to save them with readonly etc.

In the database is a tab for Keypads.  This is how the physical ports on the seven input models in the cabinets (by the controller) are arraged.  The top half of a module corresponds to the left side of this "virtual" keypads and the lower the right.  Each module has been labeled so  you can tell which keypad number it corresponds to.  One can control the keypads through software using the control panel but you MUST load in the latest prg (program file) first.  If need be you should download it from the controller, but the last program file upload (and saved) will work fine.   

They System works like this.   A keyapd pair of keys (going vertically) represent a real switch (maybe) in the house.  By setting one to toggle on and the toggle off then on and off are relative and not absolute (i.e. on could be the top button or not, depends on the current state).  So each pair of keys from the keypad are associated with virtual load groups.  Each load group can contain one or more actual physical loads which correspond to one of the "outputs" on one of the litetouch "dimmer" relay modules in the other two cabinets.  These are labled  by number and outupt but also by a three digit number the electricians used when pulling wires.  For example Load  L001 (wire) is connect to Module 2 output 2  (Module Address 02-2)

For any pairs of keys on the virtural keypads not associated with a physical switch these can be set up to be "pushed" via a software interface like the ios App or less conveniently the Control Panel Program.
